As I understand it, for the generated GLAD code the Apache Licence 2.0 applies which GPL 3 should is compatible with (I am not a lawyer so I might be wrong). See `Now the Apache License may apply to the generated code (not a lawyer), but see this clarifying comment` at [https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad/blob/master/README.md) linking to [https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Registry/issues/376#issuecomment-596187053] (https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Registry/issues/376#issuecomment-596187053). See [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html) which shows that the Apache Licence 2.0 is compatible with GPL 3 (again, I am not a lawyer).


As for LearnOpenGL, since I am using C instead of C++ and that I did not copy any of the code samples, they should not be infringing on Joey de Vries'es copyright, however I am not a lawyer so not fully sure.
